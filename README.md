# Goal

Using Breath-First-Search and Depth-First Search algorithms to not just find the goal in a maze problem, but find the optimal path in reaching the goal in order to solve the Maze problem. It will also be able to solve an Eight Puzzle problem using these algorithms.

# Methodology

I used a Stacks based Breath-First-Searcher and a Queue based Depth-First-searcher to find a path to the goal in the Maze. I then modelled the Eight Puzzle problem as a search problem and used these algorithms to find a path to the goal to solve the Eight Puzzle problem.
