# Goal

Using Breath-First-Search and Depth-First Search algorithms to not just find the goal in a maze problem, but find the optimal path in reaching the goal in order to solve the Maze problem. It will also be able to solve an Eight Puzzle sliding problem using these algorithms.

# Methodology

I used a Stacks-based Breath-First-Searcher and a Queue-based Depth-First-searcher to find a path to the goal in a Maze. I then modelled the Eight Puzzle as a search problem and then used these algorithms to find a path to the goal to solve the Eight Puzzle sliding game.
